Cute ASCII cat app 🐈‍⬛

// Add demo

After seeing Adélaïde Sky's [post](https://x.com/adelen_sky/status/1881077766604640690) in x I decided to make a similar implementation on Flutter. The second reason and purpose for the creation is to practice working with [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev).

You cat find this cat [here](https://emojicombos.com/cat).
```

Dart version

```dart
Text(
    isTailMoving
    ? ' ╱|、\n(˚ˎ 。7\n l、˜〵\n じしˍ,)ノ'
    : ' ╱|、\n(˚ˎ 。7\n l、˜〵\n じしˍ,)︵',
),
```
